                    Shelter means protection during period of crisis. The people of Bangladesh, a
                    country prone to natural disasters, are familiar with the ‘Cyclone Shelter’. But
                    the concept of flood shelter is relatively new. Traditionally, embankments are
                    most commonly used as shelters during floods.

                    The ultimate goal of education is to help an individual navigate life and contribute to society once

                    the way one’s
                    education success is measured.

                Following natural disasters like a hurricane or earthquake, many people rely on the generosity of
                strangers to help rebuild their lives. <br>
                Donations to disaster relief organizations, local food and
                diaper
                banks, and other charities can make a big difference to people in great need.
                However, we know that not everyone who can donate to these organizations ends up opening their
                wallets.

                Being public with one's pledge to donate not only spreads information about how easy it is to fight
                global poverty with a serious commitment, but that such commitments are the kind of thing that people
                can actually take. By being public with these pledges, we can actually inspire people to give, where
                they otherwise wouldn't.
